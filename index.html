        <p>Hello, i am usman bala usman, a student of software engineering aspiring to become a great engineer and problem solver. I found out about software development and how awesome it is when i was like ten years old, since then i have always wanted to be a software developer. I started my journey with the BASIC programming language it was really awesome it provided me with insights of what programming really is. not long after that i learnt about web programming and HTML, i found it intresting. my first website was about the fastest cars in the cars i can't forget i always carried it in my flash drive. ;)
